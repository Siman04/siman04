## About Me

I'm a backend software engineering learner at ALX, driven by a passion for building reliable, scalable, and efficient systems that solve real-world problems.

I chose software engineering because I’ve always been fascinated by how things work under the hood—how simple lines of code can power complex systems, improve lives, and scale globally. What inspires me most is the potential of technology to create meaningful impact, especially when combined with collaboration, open-source thinking, and continuous learning.

Right now, I’m focused on mastering backend technologies like **Python, Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL,** and **cloud infrastructure**. My goal is to become a backend engineer who not only writes clean, maintainable code but also contributes to well-architected systems that deliver value at scale.

I'm especially interested in working on projects that involve **APIs, system design, DevOps automation,** and **infrastructure as code**. Whether it’s contributing to open-source or collaborating on high-impact products, I’m here to build and grow.

Let’s connect if you’re working on something exciting or if you’re looking for someone who’s hungry to learn, build, and make a difference through code.
